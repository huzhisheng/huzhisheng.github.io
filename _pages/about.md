Hello, I'm Zhisheng Hu, a Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), [the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) from 2023, supervised by [Prof. Ming-Chang Yang](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~mcyang/). I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HITSZ)](http://en.hitsz.edu.cn/) in 2022. My research interests include distributed systems, storage systems, and machine learning systems.

During my undergraduate studies at HITSZ, I conducted research on flash file systems under the guidance of [Prof. Wen Xia](https://cswxia.github.io/), focusing on optimizing performance while ensuring wear leveling of the flash media. 

From December 2021 to July 2022, I worked as a research intern at [the Cloud Storage Innovation Lab of Huawei Cloud](https://www.huaweicloud.com/lab/storage/home.html), supervised by [Dr. Pengfei Zuo](http://pfzuo.github.io/homepage/). There, I focused on building next-generation efficient disaggregated memory systems.

For more information about Zhisheng’s background, please refer to the [CV](http://huzhisheng.github.io/files/MyEnglishCV-v3.pdf).
