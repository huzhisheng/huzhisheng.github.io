Hello, I'm Zhisheng Hu, a second-year Ph.D. student at CSE Department, CUHK(The Chinese University of Hong Kong), supervised by [Prof. Ming-Chang Yang](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~mcyang/). I received my B.Sc. in computer science and technology from [Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)](http://en.hitsz.edu.cn/) in 2022. My research interest locates in systems, such as Operating System, Database, Cloud Computing and Distributed System.

During my undergraduate period in Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), under the guidance of [Prof. Wen Xia](https://cswxia.github.io/), I studied the flash file system and tried to optimize the performance of the flash file system while ensuring the wear leveling of the flash media.

I worked in [Huawei Cloud's Cloud Storage Innovation Lab](https://www.huaweicloud.com/lab/storage/home.html) as a research intern from 2021/12/29 to 2022/07/08 under the supervision of [Dr. Pengfei Zuo](http://pfzuo.github.io/homepage/). In Cloud Storage Innovation Lab, I focused on building the next generation high efficient disaggregated memory.
